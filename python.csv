Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with setuid account management tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8)."

The Python multiprocessing library, when used with the forkserver start method on Linux, allows pickles to be deserialized from any user in the same machine local network namespace, which in many system configurations means any user on the same machine. Pickles can execute arbitrary code. Thus, this allows for local user privilege escalation to the user that any forkserver process is running as. Setting multiprocessing.util.abstract_sockets_supported to False is a workaround. The forkserver start method for multiprocessing is not the default start method. This issue is Linux specific because only Linux supports abstract namespace sockets. CPython before 3.9 does not make use of Linux abstract namespace sockets by default. Support for users manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a bugfix in 3.7.8 and 3.8.3, but users would need to make specific uncommon API calls in order to do that in CPython before 3.9."

Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16."

Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in C:\.git\config. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder .git on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround. Alternatively, define or extend GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES to cover the parent directory of the user profile, e.g. C:\Users if the user profile is located in C:\Users\my-user-name."

When performing a local clone (where the source and target of the clone are on the same volume), Git copies the contents of the source's $GIT_DIR/objects directory into the destination by either creating hardlinks to the source contents, or copying them (if hardlinks are disabled via --no-hardlinks). A malicious actor could convince a victim to clone a repository with a symbolic link pointing at sensitive information on the victim's machine. This can be done either by having the victim clone a malicious repository on the same machine, or having them clone a malicious repository embedded as a bare repository via a submodule from any source, provided they clone with the --recurse-submodules option. Git does not create symbolic links in the $GIT_DIR/objects directory. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2022-10-18, and backported to v2.30.x. Potential workarounds: Avoid cloning untrusted repositories using the --local optimization when on a shared machine, either by passing the --no-local option to git clone or cloning from a URL that uses the file:// scheme. Alternatively, avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with --recurse-submodules or run git config --global protocol.file.allow user."

Because the resulting array is then passed to execv(), it is possible to leverage this attack to gain remote code execution on a victim machine. Note that a victim must first allow access to git shell as a login shell in order to be vulnerable to this attack.
