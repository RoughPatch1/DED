0,Uncontrolled Recursion in pcre3 | CVE-2017-11164 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-11164,Ubuntu:22.04,"In PCRE 8.41, the OP_KETRMAX feature in the match function in pcre_exec.c allows stack exhaustion (uncontrolled recursion) when processing a crafted regular expression."
1,Improper Locking in openssl | CVE-2022-3996 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3996,Ubuntu:22.04,"If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice recursively. On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs. Policy processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered to be a common setup. Policy processing is enabled by passing the -policy&#39; argument to the command line utilities or by calling either X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy()' or `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' functions."

4,Integer Overflow or Wraparound in krb5 | CVE-2018-5709 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-5709,Ubuntu:22.04,"An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16. There is a variable ""dbentry->n_key_data"" in kadmin/dbutil/dump.c that can store 16-bit data but unknowingly the developer has assigned a ""u4"" variable to it, which is for 32-bit data. An attacker can use this vulnerability to affect other artifacts of the database as we know that a Kerberos database dump file contains trusted data."

Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. However, the HSTS mechanism could be bypassed if the host name in the given URL first uses IDN characters that get replaced to ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion. Like using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop (U+002E) .. Then in a subsequent request, it does not detect the HSTS state and makes a clear text transfer. Because it would store the info IDN encoded but look for it IDN decoded."
