2,Release of Invalid Pointer or Reference in patch | CVE-2021-45261 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-45261,Ubuntu:22.04,"An Invalid Pointer vulnerability exists in GNU patch 2.7 via the another_hunk function, which causes a Denial of Service."
3,Improper Locking in openssl | CVE-2022-3996 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3996,Ubuntu:22.04,"If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice recursively. On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs. Policy processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered to be a common setup. Policy processing is enabled by passing the -policy&#39; argument to the command line utilities or by calling either X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy()' or `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' functions."
4,Improper Privilege Management in openssh | CVE-2021-41617 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-41617,Ubuntu:22.04,"sshd in OpenSSH 6.2 through 8.x before 8.8, when certain non-default configurations are used, allows privilege escalation because supplemental groups are not initialized as expected. Helper programs for AuthorizedKeysCommand and AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand may run with privileges associated with group memberships of the sshd process, if the configuration specifies running the command as a different user."

This allows man-in-the-middle attackers to target initial connection attempts (where no host key for the server has been cached by the client). NOTE: some reports state that 8.5 and 8.6 are also affected.
6,Out-of-bounds Read in ncurses | CVE-2022-29458 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29458,Ubuntu:22.04,ncurses 6.3 before patch 20220416 has an out-of-bounds read and segmentation violation in convert_strings in tinfo/read_entry.c in the terminfo library.

There is a variable ""dbentry->n_key_data"" in kadmin/dbutil/dump.c that can store 16-bit data but unknowingly the developer has assigned a ""u4"" variable to it, which is for 32-bit data. An attacker can use this vulnerability to affect other artifacts of the database as we know that a Kerberos database dump file contains trusted data."

21,Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information in curl | CVE-2022-43551 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-43551,Ubuntu:22.04,"A vulnerability exists in curl <7.87.0 HSTS check that could be bypassed to trick it to keep using HTTP. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. However, the HSTS mechanism could be bypassed if the host name in the given URL first uses IDN characters that get replaced to ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion. Like using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop (U+002E) .. Then in a subsequent request, it does not detect the HSTS state and makes a clear text transfer. Because it would store the info IDN encoded but look for it IDN decoded."
