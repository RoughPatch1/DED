60,Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere in curl | CVE-2022-32221 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-32221,Debian:11,"When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (CURLOPT_READFUNCTION) to ask for data to send, even when the CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS option has been set, if the same handle previously was used to issue a PUT request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent POST request. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is changed from a PUT to a POST."
