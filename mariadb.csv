1,Improper Locking in openssl | CVE-2022-3996 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3996,Ubuntu:22.04,"If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice recursively. On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs. Policy processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered to be a common setup. Policy processing is enabled by passing the -policy&#39; argument to the command line utilities or by calling either X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy()' or `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' functions."
2,Out-of-bounds Read in ncurses | CVE-2022-29458 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29458,Ubuntu:22.04,ncurses 6.3 before patch 20220416 has an out-of-bounds read and segmentation violation in convert_strings in tinfo/read_entry.c in the terminfo library.
3,Integer Overflow or Wraparound in krb5 | CVE-2018-5709 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-5709,Ubuntu:22.04,"An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16.
