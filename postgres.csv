,Name,Link,Affected Package,Description
0,Information Exposure in util-linux | CVE-2022-0563 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0563,Debian:11,"A flaw was found in the util-linux chfn and chsh utilities when compiled with Readline support. The Readline library uses an ""INPUTRC"" environment variable to get a path to the library config file. When the library cannot parse the specified file, it prints an error message containing data from the file. This flaw allows an unprivileged user to read root-owned files, potentially leading to privilege escalation. This flaw affects util-linux versions prior to 2.37.4."
1,CVE-2005-2541 in tar | CVE-2005-2541 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2541,Debian:11,"Tar 1.15.1 does not properly warn the user when extracting setuid or setgid files, which may allow local users or remote attackers to gain privileges."
2,Authentication Bypass in systemd | CVE-2020-13529 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-13529,Debian:11,An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in Systemd 245. A specially crafted DHCP FORCERENEW packet can cause a server running the DHCP client to be vulnerable to a DHCP ACK spoofing attack. An attacker can forge a pair of FORCERENEW and DCHP ACK packets to reconfigure the server.
3,Off-by-one Error in systemd | CVE-2022-3821 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3821,Debian:11,"An off-by-one Error issue was discovered in Systemd in format_timespan() function of time-util.c. An attacker could supply specific values for time and accuracy that leads to buffer overrun in format_timespan(), leading to a Denial of Service."
4,CVE-2022-4415 in systemd | CVE-2022-4415 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4415,Debian:11,A vulnerability was found in systemd. This security flaw can cause a local information leak due to systemd-coredump not respecting the fs.suid_dumpable kernel setting.
5,Link Following in systemd | CVE-2013-4392 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-4392,Debian:11,"systemd, when updating file permissions, allows local users to change the permissions and SELinux security contexts for arbitrary files via a symlink attack on unspecified files."
6,Out-of-bounds Read in sqlite3 | CVE-2021-36690 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36690,Debian:11,"** DISPUTED ** A segmentation fault can occur in the sqlite3.exe command-line component of SQLite 3.36.0 via the idxGetTableInfo function when there is a crafted SQL query. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report because a sqlite3.exe user already has full privileges (e.g., is intentionally allowed to execute commands). This report does NOT imply any problem in the SQLite library."
7,Memory Leak in sqlite3 | CVE-2021-45346 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-45346,Debian:11,"** DISPUTED ** A Memory Leak vulnerability exists in SQLite Project SQLite3 3.35.1 and 3.37.0 via maliciously crafted SQL Queries (made via editing the Database File), it is possible to query a record, and leak subsequent bytes of memory that extend beyond the record, which could let a malicious user obtain sensitive information. NOTE: The developer disputes this as a vulnerability stating that If you give SQLite a corrupted database file and submit a query against the database, it might read parts of the database that you did not intend or expect."
8,Improper Validation of Array Index in sqlite3 | CVE-2022-35737 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-35737,Debian:11,SQLite 1.0.12 through 3.39.x before 3.39.2 sometimes allows an array-bounds overflow if billions of bytes are used in a string argument to a C API.
9,Access Restriction Bypass in shadow | CVE-2007-5686 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-5686,Debian:11,"initscripts in rPath Linux 1 sets insecure permissions for the /var/log/btmp file, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information regarding authentication attempts.  NOTE: because sshd detects the insecure permissions and does not log certain events, this also prevents sshd from logging failed authentication attempts by remote attackers."
10,Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) in shadow | CVE-2013-4235 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-4235,Debian:11,shadow: TOCTOU (time-of-check time-of-use) race condition when copying and removing directory trees
11,Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource in shadow | CVE-2019-19882 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-19882,Debian:11,"shadow 4.8, in certain circumstances affecting at least Gentoo, Arch Linux, and Void Linux, allows local users to obtain root access because setuid programs are misconfigured. Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with setuid account management tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8)."
12,Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in perl | CVE-2020-16156 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-16156,Debian:11,CPAN 2.28 allows Signature Verification Bypass.

19,Inadequate Encryption Strength in openssl | CVE-2022-2097 | Snyk,https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2097,Debian:11,"AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of ""in place"" encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.5 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1q (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p)."
